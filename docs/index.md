## Wikidata for Digital Preservation
Members of the digital preservation community collate and capture metadata to describe file formats, software, operating systems and hardware, and use it to inform and drive digital preservation processes. The vision of Wikidata for Digital Preservation is to use Wikidata as a technical registry of metadata related to computer software and computing environments. Collaboratively creating this metadata, and making it available as linked open data, will reduce the amount of redundant work digital preservation professionals do in order to describe resources. Having machine-readable, linked open data that describes the digital preservation domain will also allow us to reuse this data in our software applications and information systems, reducing the overhead when building new tools.
