## Wikidata for Digital Preservation
Members of the digital preservation community collate and capture metadata to describe file formats, software, operating systems and hardware, and use it to inform and drive digital preservation processes. The vision of Wikidata for Digital Preservation is to use Wikidata as a technical registry of metadata related to computer software and computing environments. Collaboratively creating this metadata, and making it available as linked open data, will reduce the amount of redundant work digital preservation professionals do in order to describe resources. Having machine-readable, linked open data that describes the digital preservation domain will also allow us to reuse this data in our software applications and information systems, reducing the overhead when building new tools. 




## How to Contribute
This application will allow you to find the correct Wikidata item for software or file formats about which you would like to add information.

### Step 1: Find Item

### Step 2: Contribute statements

### Step 3: 












## Here are some types of work that would be very helpful to the project. 

### Connecting file formats and software

We need to create statements on software items using property [readable file format](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1072) and [writable file format](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P1072) to indicate relationships with file formats.

This information is available from the software itself. It is also sometimes described in the user manual or on a website about the software.
#### Reference example
This is an item with relatively complete information about how it relates to file formats: [GIMP image processing software](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q8038).
